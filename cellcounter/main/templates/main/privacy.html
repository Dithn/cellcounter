<div id="privacy">
<h4>User accounts</h4>

<p>Users that choose to register with CellCountr are identified by their chosen username. Users select a password, which is confidential and stored in an encrypted form and used to verify the integrity of their account. Users who provide a valid email address can use it to reset their user password if necessary. Except insofar as it may be required by law, CellCountr will not disclose, or knowingly expose, either user email addresses or user passwords.</p>

<h4>Keyboard map</h4>

<p>Registered users may store a customised keyboard map. We do not consider this to constitute personal data but nevertheless will not disclose, or knowingly expose, this data.</p>

<h4>IP and other technical information.</h4>

<p>When a visitor requests or reads a page no more information is collected than is typically collected by web sites. CellCountr may keep raw logs of such transactions, but these will not be published or used to track legitimate users. During the performance of cell counts, Cellcountr will store the total number of cells counted, and completion of a count for monitoring service usage.</p>

<h4>Disclaimer</h4>

<p>CellCountr believes that maintaining and preserving the privacy of user data is an important value. This Privacy Policy, together with other policies, resolutions, and actions by CellCountr, represents a committed effort to safeguard the security of the limited user information that is collected and retained on our servers. Nevertheless, CellCountr cannot guarantee that user information will remain private. We acknowledge that, in spite of our committed effort to protect private user information, determined individuals may still develop data-mining and other methods to uncover such information and disclose it. For this reason, CellCountr can make no guarantee against unauthorized access to information provided.</p>
